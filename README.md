# RetroCRT

RetroCRT is a suite of tools designed to make [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk) gaming on CRTs easy and user friendly.

Compared to every distro I've seen out there, one of the biggest advantages of using RetroCRT is that we're only updating configuration files line-by-line instead of overwriting everything.  This means that RetroCRT should be able to coexist with RetroPie and probably almost everything else you're running.

# Troubleshooting

Before doing anything else, update RetroCRT!  You can do this in the RetroPie screen in EmulationStation.

If that doesn't fix it, see the [troubleshooting doc](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

# Footnotes

I am not affiliated with RetroPie, Mike Chi, RetroTink, pi2jamma, or anyone else.  I'm doing this as a personal project.

Shout out to [Vykran](https://github.com/Vykyan/retroTINK-setup) for the initial groundwork, though he seems to be PAL & I'm NTSC... which brought us to where we are now.
